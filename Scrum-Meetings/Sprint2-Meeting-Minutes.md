# Scrum Meetings - *Sprint 2*

### *Monday, November 18th, 2024*

**Discussion**: Discussed points we each need to finish from previous sprint: a bit of automation testing across each feature.
We talked about expected deadlines and creating a new timeline document for the current sprint as well as the stakeholder expectations.
The RTM will be relatively the same, but we will need to update the Test Plan Document due to the current sprint including
unit and integration testing. In terms of the split of work, the team will follow the same format with how we divided the
work by features.

- TK: Registration features
- HN: Viewing planetarium features
- II: Planet features
- MF: Moon features

**Blockers**: Team occupied with client interviews

### *Tuesday, November 19th, 2024*

**Accomplishments**: Finished Test Strategies documentation, timeline document, JIRA board for current sprint, and skeleton 
for unit tests together

**Discussion**: Discussed the product's MVP requirements and what files we need to test in order to get to that point. We also 
did a mini sprint retrospective in order to plan our current timeline with more realistic goals. II organized the repo 
and added the source code. TK updated the pom.xml to include new dependencies for the current sprint. MF drove the peer programming today.

**Blockers**: Our understanding of the current project was a bit lacking, but this has been cleared up

**Goal**: Finish our test case writing by Monday, November 25th

**Moving Forward**:
- TK: User controller, repository, and DAO
- HN: View controller
- II: Planet controller, repository, and DAO + fixing automation tests
- MF: Moon controller, repository, and DAO
