# Scrum Meetings - *Sprint 2*

### *Monday, November 18th, 2024*

**Discussion**: Discussed points we each need to finish from previous sprint: a bit of automation testing across each feature.
We talked about expected deadlines and creating a new timeline document for the current sprint as well as the stakeholder expectations.
The RTM will be relatively the same, but we will need to update the Test Plan Document due to the current sprint including
unit and integration testing. In terms of the split of work, the team will follow the same format with how we divided the
work by features.

- TK: Registration features
- HN: Viewing planetarium features
- II: Planet features
- MF: Moon features

**Blockers**: Team occupied with client interviews
