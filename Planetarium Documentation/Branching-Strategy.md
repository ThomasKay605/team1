# Branching Strategy
Example: {*firstName*}-featureBeingImplemented

Merging is protected through enforced rules on GitHub. To merge a branch, a pull request must be made. Then,
another developer must review and approve the pull request in order to merge branches.

Keep the scrum branch exclusively for meeting minutes.
